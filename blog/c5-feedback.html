      <p>It's fun to pair with others on challenges. You get to know another person's thinking style, and their knowledge and different way of approaching things helps you learn. Sometimes I get stressed out about scheduling pairing sessions, especially when I'm traveling and have small timeframes and an uncertain schedule, but once I sit down to start a pairing session with someone all of that stress vanishes and we get absorbed in the problem at hand. I love it when a breakthrough comes after we've been slogging away at a problem, or when something one of us suggests suddenly expands our knowledge of Ruby.</p>
      <p>I found a pattern in the constructive criticism in my feedback, which was that I tend to jump in and start experimenting when faced with a challenge, and might not always take the time to explain myself well enough to my partner. I know I do this, and the VARK personality test confirmed this trait by indicating that I'm a concrete random thinker. I would definitely benefit from slowing down and mapping out a solution to the problem beforehand, as my partners suggested. After receiving this feedback, I've been taking my psuedocode more seriously and trying to spend more time thinking through each step of the process before going off to research methods to help. I'm also trying to work on verbalizing my thought process, so I don't lose my partners in my rush to get things done.</p>
      <p>I like giving positive feedback to partners, but it's often hard for me to come up with constructive criticism that's specific and actionable. I usually want to praise the person, say the pairing session went well, and say keep doing what you're doing, but that's not as helpful as something that at least attempts to point out a weak spot. When I step back to think about what they could improve upon, it sometimes surprises me with what I come up with. I realize that they could do more research on methods, or articulate their thought process more clearly, or something like that which I had overlooked before. I think that sometimes when I like people, I suppress critical thoughts, but those observations are actually useful if they are brought into the open and articulated kindly.</p>
      <p>The process of giving and receiving feedback is helping me improve on my coding, but it's also helping me learn how to be more honest with myself and others. </p>
