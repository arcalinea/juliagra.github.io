      <p>Stereotype threat is the expectation of judgment from others that leads people from a group that suffers from negative stereotypes to perform below their ability.</p>
      <p>Our self-image is molded by the way others perceive us, so judgments and expectations placed upon us by others can be internalized. When these judgments are negative, they can undermine us, causing us to subconsciously sabotage our performance even when we're capable of more.</p>
      <p>In trying to recall a personal experience of stereotype threat, I'm remembering several instances in the past when I've been in spaces where men were dominating the discussion. The desire to speak up began to recede as I subconsciously conformed to the stereotype that women are quiet and have nothing to say. At that point, even if I wanted to correct a factual inaccuracy, I might second-guess myself and keep quiet. </p>
      <p>To reduce stereotype threat, a safe space must be maintained. People should feel respected as individuals and evaluated according to their abilities. One article on stereotype threat mentioned that for one group of college students, weekly discussions among students of different races, from different backgrounds, helped to ease feelings of stereotype threat. When members of one group could hear members of another expressing the same kind of anxieties they had, their concerns at being profiled according to a stereotype were lessened. </p>
      <p>The discussion sessions at Dev Bootcamp will probably have a similar function. Already, the experience of seeing other students write about their anxieties on an email thread has let us see that everyone is worrying about the same things. Encouraging everyone to speak up and feel like their perspective is valued will be an important part of building trust in each other in order to learn at our maximum potential. </p>
