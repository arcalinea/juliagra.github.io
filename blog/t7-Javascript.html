      <p>When writing loops in Javascript, I found it difficult at first to remember that it doesn't have the same build-in methods for looping that Ruby does. Javascript only has a few specialized looping functions, which means you have to break problems down into smaller steps.</p>
      <p>To write a loop in Ruby, there is #each, #map, #while, #until, #num... times do, #loop do, #each_with_index, #for, and probably other methods. Most of these are well-documented and well-mantained. There are so many methods for loops, in fact, that the "for" loop is seldom used.</p>
      <p>In Javascript, on the other hand, there are only a handful of looping methods. There is "for", "while", "do-while", "forEach", and "for-in". The "for-in" loop is deprecated and is no longer being actively maintained. "forEach" takes three arguments and is more complicated to write than #each in Ruby. That leaves the basic "for", and "while" loop, which are still capable of many of the functions you need loops for, but require more manual work to set up.</p>
      <p>So far, I think I prefer writing loops in Ruby because of how convenient the built-in methods are. However, looping in Javascript requires me to break a problem down into smaller parts because it lacks fancy methods. </p>
