    <h2>Combating Stereotype threat</h2>

      <p>Last week we researched and wrote a post about stereotype threat, the documented pheomenon where people from negatively stereotyped groups internalize anticipated judgments about themselves and perform below their ability because of it. The social environment and our perceptions of ourselves in it has a deep, almost subconsious role in shaping how we act. </p>
      <p>To combat sterotype threat, it's important to remind ourselves of our values, so that we're centered in the best version of who we know we're capable of being, rather than caught up in other people's judgments. I try to center myself in community, creativity, and curiosity.</p>
      <p>I think of community and freedom together because when we want to be free of some social oppression, the best way to do it is by building a liberated space with other people. By ourselves, our only choices are to conform to or reject the consensus reality. With others, we can build up a new narrative and transform it. For example, when facing stereotype threat, if you are alone or think you are alone in battling negative judgments, you must retreat to an isolated position of defense in your mind. If, however, you have a community that supports you to discuss these experiences with, it reaffirms your self-worth and can give you the strength to speak out, engaging with these perceptions directly and perhaps transforming the space.</p>
      <p>Sometimes communities we are tied to can be difficult to inhabit. When our social environment is filled with all sorts of judgments, pressures, and misperceptions, it’s so important to learn how to speak our truth and push back from a place of love and consideration. We are only able to move towards a shared understanding when confrontation takes place in a way where people feel respected and are able to listen to one another. Freedom from others is a weak sort of freedom. Only when we find freedom with others can we truly flourish and transform our world for the better. </p>
      <p>Remaining creative and curious about the world is what renews me. I’m learning how to code because I’m curious about how computers work and want to have the ability to create with new tools. It's hard work to master the tools of a craft well enough so that ideas can flow off the fingertips, but it's well worth it. When working in the state of flow where one loses sense of the distinction between creator, instrument, and creation, there is a deep sense of harmony.</p>
      <p>When I get stuck, these are qualities I draw upon to push me forward again. I try to get curious about what the block is, and come up with ways to transform or get around it. This can apply to people too. When we feel stereotyped, it’s interesting to ask why the person judging us feels the need to constrain our humanity in a labeled box. It could be coming from inner insecurity, a historical legacy, or lack of exposure to different perspectives. If we see their judgment as emanating from them for reasons that don’t actually have much to do with us, we can brush it off and have some understanding of them. Then we can speak and try to listen and be heard. </p>
