    <h1>Values</h1>
    <h2>Combating Stereotype threat</h2>

      <p>Last week we researched and wrote a post about stereotype threat, the documented pheomenon where people from negatively stereotyped groups internalize anticipated judgments about themselves and perform below their ability because of it. The social environment and our perceptions of ourselves in it has a deep, almost subconsious role in shaping how we act. </p>
      <p>To combat sterotype threat, it's important to remind ourselves of our values, so that we're centered in the best version of who we know we're capable of being, rather than caught up in other people's judgments. I try to center myself in community, creativity, and curiosity.</p>
      <p>Community is important because we are all a node in a network of relationships, influencing and being influenced by those around us. I try to be the best version of myself not just for me, but for those around me, and remember the importance of what I do for those that matter the most to me. If confronted with negative judgments, I'll just remember the regard of those who believe in me.</p>
      <p>Creativity is important because I believe humans are creatures of infinite possibility, capable of imagining alternate worlds and bringing them to life, and it's mainly ideology and conditioning that cuts us off from this potential. It's hard work to master the tools of a craft well enough so that ideas can flow off the fingertips, but it's well worth it. When working in the timeless state of flow where one loses sense of the distinction between creator, instrument, and creation, there is a deep sense of harmony that seems to reveal an essential truth--that the division between self and world is a temporary screen of consciousness, and when absorbed in full concentration, one is really a part of the process of creation itself. </p>
      <p>Curiosity springs from wonder, and is one of the motivating forces that drives me forward to engage with world. I find it amazing that we can use these light-boxes, computers, to manipulate symbols that transmit signals that create virtual realities that affect things in the real world, over great distances. I'd like to learn how to talk with them.</p>
      <p>When giving friends advice, I tend to talk about these things. Find a community that shares your values, this will reinforce the person you want to be. Volunteer or contribute some of your time to a greater good, you'll feel like an integral part of the social fabric. Choose to spend your free time on actively creative rather than passively consumerist entertainments, you'll feel more alive. Don't accept depressing ideologies or easy answers, the world is infinitely mysterious and there is always more to explore.</p>
