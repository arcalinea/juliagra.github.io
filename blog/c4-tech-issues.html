      <p>The lack of diversity in the tech industry is a serious problem. At many tech companies, employees are <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/diversity-stats-10-tech-companies-that-have-come-clean/">about 70% male and 30% female, and less than 5% are black or hispanic.</a> 
      <p>The lack of female and minority representation in the tech industry means that the perspectives of much of the population are not reflected in the process of design of digital products. Marginalized communities are also cut off from the resources available in the tech industry. </p>
      <p>Possible solutions include increasing the representation of women and minorities in the tech industry. Bootcamps like this one are making an effort to provide more scholarships for marginalized people to learn how to code and enter the tech industry. Companies are trying to adopt more progressive hiring policies. However, even if these efforts are successful, they are only superficial solutions. There is still a structural problem of the creation and control of digital products being limited to a small section of society. This cannot be addressed without more education on the use of digital tools, and expanded access to computers and broadband in marginalized communities. </p>
      <p>"The digital divide" is a term given to the increasing inequality of opportunities available to communities with different levels of access to digital technology. Internet access is a portal to education, healthcare, and jobs, but *Insert statistics on internet access*. Lower prices and expanded coverage could help solve this problem, but this isn't likely to happen without more competition among Internet providers. In the US, broadband markets in major urban areas have been divided among a few major providers that do not compete with each other, and these companies often won't build out in rural areas where it's not profitable for them. Possible solutions include dismantling regulatory barriers to municipal broadband, so that communities can built out their own Internet infrastructure. </p>
      <p>As for education, it's important to meet people where they're at. Bootcamps are great, but they're still only an option for a few. More free options for technical education in libraries and schools would be great. </p>
