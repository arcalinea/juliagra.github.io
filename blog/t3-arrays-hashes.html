     <h4>What's the difference?</h4>
      <p>An array is an ordered data structure, where each entry receives a numbered index that starts from 0. Any object can be stored in an array, but the index is always a number starting from 0 for the 1st item in the array. A hash is an unordered data structure, where instead of a numbered index, each entry receives a "key" that can be a string, a value, or anything you want--even an array can be used as a key. Hashes are sometimes called associative arrays, because their values associate to something other than numbers.</p>
     <h4>When to use which?</h4>
      <p>Both arrays and hashes have their uses. An array is good when you have an ordered data set. However, a hash is useful when you have a bunch of data that doesn't come in any particular order, but you need a way to store and reference it.</p>
      <p>Say you want to store the latin names of new species of local flora and fauna. You like to add new critters as you come across them, and don't want to play favorites by ordering one before another. In this case, you'd want to use a hash. Below I've listed some of the ways to create such a hash. Note that hashes use curly braces, rather than the vertical braces of arrays.</p>

      <p>Now say you want to keep track of the new students who register for your herbal medicine class, and store their names in the order that they sign up. An array would be a good data structure to store this ordered list. Some examples of how to create an array are displayed below.</p>
