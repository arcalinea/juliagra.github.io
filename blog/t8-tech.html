      <p>I was amazed when I first learned about regular expressions. Using a brief set of characters, it’s possible to search a string of text for almost anything you want. Regular expressions are powerful tools that help in pattern matching, for example with find and replace operations. </p>
      <p>Many programming languages, including Ruby and Javascript, have built-in regular expression capabilities. Others offer their functionality through a library. Each character in a regular expression is either a “metacharacter” with a special meaning that performs an operation, or a regular character that is understood according to its literal meaning. </p>
      <p>Here are some of the basic concepts of regular expressions. </p>
      <li>
        <ul>Boolean “or”</ul>
          <ul>You can use a vertical bar to separate alternatives.  For example, gray | grey matches gray or grey.</ul>
        <ul>Grouping</ul>
          <ul>Parentheses are used to group operators. Using the example above, gr( a | e )y also will match gray or grey.</ul>
        <ul>Quantification</ul>
          <ul>Quantifying characters specify how often an element is allowed to occur. Some of the most common ones are the question mark, the asterisk, and the plus sign.</ul>
          <ul>? indicates zero or one elements</ul>
          <ul>* indicates zero or more elements</ul>
          <ul>+ indicates one or more elements</ul>
      </li>
