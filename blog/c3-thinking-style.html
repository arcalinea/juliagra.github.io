     <h4>My thinking style</h4>
      <p>Alright, time for some meta-level cultural analysis of the Dev Bootcamp experience so far. My biggest struggle or annoyance has been writing all the reflections and emails and blog posts and filling out all the forms and quizzes. This seems to take as much time as the actual coding. I complained about this on the last submission form. This problem actually does sound related to my learning style though. As a primarily concrete random thinker, with a secondary abstract sequential way of processing information, I get frustrated with formal reports, records, and repetition. I'm remembering now how in math class I used to complain about having to show how I got my answer. Wasn't it enough that I just figured it out in my head? No. Over the years I learned how to show my thought process. This is especially important with computers, since they only execute exactly what you tell them to. You must exhaustively detail every step of the process.</p>
      <p>However, technical and cultural reflections are different. The goal seems to be documenting what you've learned for future reference, so that others can benefit from your knowledge, and so that you can consolidate the information you just absorbed. I understand this, I just resent the time it takes. This is mostly due to my own perfectionistic tendencies, since once I sit down to write something I can't stop halfway. I'll have to try jotting things down fast and submitting what I've got. Maybe do more timeboxing.</p>
      <p>As with coding, I definitely jump in and start experimenting right away. This has worked for me so far, but as programs get more complicated I will probably need to slow down and spend more time psuedocoding to develop some strategy first.</p>
      <p>I definitely have room to grow by working with others who approach problems differently.</p>
