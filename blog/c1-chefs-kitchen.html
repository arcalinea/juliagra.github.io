     <h4>Unknown Unknowns</h4>
      <p>
        “If you're not worried, you should be. And get in a creator mindset.” That's the gist of what I heard in the introductory video. We're encouraged to cultivate a productive anxiety, so we don't lean back and think that completing the assignments is all that's required to become a web developer in 18 weeks. This model has succeeded so far because of the voracious hunger that the self-selecting group of students crazy for learning comes in with. Just because Kaplan bought Dev Bootcamp doesn't mean this is now the AP test or something, where you're automatically going to get credit if you answer all the multiple-choice questions correctly. To be successful we're going to have to keep the DIY mentality. At this stage, there's an infinite amount of material we could be learning, we've waded about two inches deep into an ocean of knowledge. 
      <p>
         Standing at the shore of the Programming Pacific, we don't even know what we don't know—how deep it goes, what we need to navigate, how to get from point A to point B. Shareef uses a lot of metaphors to help us shed our misconceptions about programming by comparing it to things we understand, like cooking vs. ordering in a restaurant, learning guitar, playing soccer, constructing houses. More than imparting a set of skills, this bootcamp tries to foster the mentality and environment that will accelerate learning and make new things possible. I jotted down the list of qualities Shareef says will determine success: “Persistence, humility, empathy, tolerance for frustration, beginner's mind, self-awareness, mindfulness, curiosity, tinkering attitude, integrity, keeping your word, people being able to trust and rely on you, being inspired by being around you... smarts are overrated. Solicit and get feedback. Know what you know, and be willing to figure out the rest.” We're not going to be competing against each other in little races, this is more like a bunch of amateurs setting sail on a ship where nobody knows how to use the instruments, and we're all going to have to help each other navigate uncharted waters.

      <h4>Learning as Liberation</h4>
      <p>
          I was surprised to hear, "everyone should read Pedagogy of the Oppressed,” but upon reflection I can see some similarities. Paolo Freire was teaching illiterate Brazilian peasants how to read, and was intent on doing so in a way that would empower them to critique and change their world. The process of learning became a liberating experience, where unlocking the secrets of the written word allowed them to see their social conditions as something that could be transformed. We're learning how to code. This is a language that unlocks today's world. In our own ways, we've all been oppressors and oppressed, and are struggling to gain the tools necessary for empowerment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Shareef saying we've been oppressed by consumer education draws from Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Freire decries the “banking” model of education as perpetuating oppressive society, because people are taught to be passive receptacles of knowledge imparted by superior authorities. <i>“Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.”</i> The goal of seeking knowledge is recovering the creative potential of one's humanity. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Dev Bootcamp treats the body and the community as crucial components of learning because in everything we do, we are grounded in our physical selves, embedded in a social context, whether we recognize it or not. Freire: <i>“Education as the practice of freedom—as opposed to education as the practice of domination—denies that man is abstract, isolated, independent, and unattached to the world; it also denies that the world exists as a reality apart from people.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm going to bring all of myself to this experience because I'm gaining a new way of relating to the world. We're not here to be passive consumers of knowledge. We want to learn how to code so that we can create things, and the first thing we'll create is our own education. We're here to be agents of transformation for ourselves, for others around us, and for the causes and communities we came in committed to. Dev Bootcamp is just a place that provides some resources for us to make that happen.

        I followed Shareef's suggestion and revisited Pedagogy of the Oppressed. I'm going to leave a few more Friere quotes here, because they raise questions I'm going to be thinking about:
        <ul> 
          <li><blockquote>“Almost always, during the initial stage of the struggle, the oppressed, instead of striving for liberation, tend themselves to become oppressors, or “sub-oppressors”... Their vision of the new man or woman is individualistic; because of their identification with the oppressor, they have no consciousness of themselves as persons or as members of an oppressed class... The “fear of freedom” which afflicts the oppressed, a fear which may equally well lead them to desire the role of oppressor or bind them to the role of the oppressed, should be examined... This book will present some aspects of that the writer has termed the pedagogy of the oppressed, a pedagogy which must be forged with, not for, the oppressed (whether individuals or peoples) in the incessant struggle to regain their humanity.” pg. 45-46 </blockquote>
          <li><blockquote>“Human existence cannot be silent, nor can it be nourished by false words, but only by true words, with which men and women transform the world. To exist, humanly, is to name the world, to change it... Human beings are not built in silence, but in word, in work, in action-reflection... To speak a true word is to transform the world.” pg. 86 </blockquote>
          <li><blockquote>“At the point of encounter there are neither utter ignoramuses nor perfect sages; there are only people who are attempting, together, to learn more than they now know.”</blockquote> 
          <li><blockquote>“More and more, the oppressors are using science and technology as unquestionably powerful instruments for their purpose: the maintenance of the oppressive order through manipulation and repression.” p. 58 </blockquote>
          <li><blockquote>“The inhumanity of the oppressors and revolutionary humanism both make use of science. But science and technology at the service of the former are used to reduce the oppressed to the status of “things”; at the service of the latter, they are used to promote humanization." pg. 131 </blockquote>
        </ul>
