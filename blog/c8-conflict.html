      <p>When faced with conflict, I find that my response usually follows a pattern. At first I withdraw, and introspect to analyze what I’m feeling. I usually have to write my thoughts down to get clarity on the situation. Then, after I’ve written out how I feel, I’m able to take action and communicate with or confront others. </p>
      <p>One time I was traveling in a foreign country with a friend who spoke the language. I had studied the language for years, but wasn’t used to speaking it and had a hard time following the speed at which native speakers would talk. Sometimes when I spoke, my friend would laugh at my mistakes. They also wouldn’t practice with me when we were alone. I felt embarrassed about my speaking skills, and became increasingly resentful that my friend wasn’t being more helpful with my attempts to improve. </p>
      <p>My response was to spend more time studying and practicing on my own. I’d spend my free time going over the vocabulary and grammar, trying to get better. I also wrote about how I was feeling, and realized I really wanted my friend’s support in learning. They didn’t understand how hard I was trying and how big of a deal it was for me. My frustration was becoming unbearable, and they weren’t even aware. I finally told my friend about my struggles, and asked them to practice with me for a day. They agreed, and when we had a conversation in the language, they were amazed at how much I actually knew. My shyness and perfectionism had kept me from speaking up in public, even though I was becoming pretty competent. </p>
      <p>In retrospect, I could have spoken up earlier. If I’d talked to my friend about my feelings of frustration and inadequacy as they arose, they would have been more sympathetic and helped me out. But my pride kept me from discussing the way I felt, and drove me to study in private. </p>
      <p>Now I’ve started to understand that other people are often not aware of the inner tension you’re experiencing, and silently building up resentment at them for not reading your mind is unproductive. The best way to clear the air and resolve a budding conflict that stems from lack of communication is to communicate, honestly and compassionately. </p>
